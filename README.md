# car_selling_price_prediction web_app
This project focuses on predicting car selling prices based on various features of the cars. The objective was to build a model that can accurately estimate the price of a car given its attributes, which can be valuable for both sellers and buyers in the automotive market. The project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and model building to achieve accurate price predictions.

Tools Used:

Python: For data manipulation, exploration, and model building.
Pandas: To handle and preprocess the dataset.
NumPy: For numerical operations and calculations.
Scikit-Learn: To implement machine learning algorithms and evaluate model performance.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization and exploring relationships between features.
Jupyter Notebook: For documenting the analysis and presenting the results.

Key Steps:

Data Collection: Acquired a dataset containing various attributes of cars and their selling prices.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Created new features to better capture the relationships between the attributes and the car prices.
Model Building: Applied different regression algorithms to predict car prices, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Results Analysis: Analyzed the results to identify the most significant factors influencing car prices and optimized the model for better accuracy.

Outcome:

Successfully developed a predictive model that provides accurate estimates of car selling prices, offering valuable insights into the factors that affect car pricing. The model achieved high accuracy and demonstrated effective handling of real-world data.
